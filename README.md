# 🌐 Shaik Saniya – Portfolio Website  

Hi, thanks for visiting my portfolio repo! 👋  

This project is my **personal portfolio website** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It’s a simple, responsive site where I showcase my **skills, projects, and resume**. The idea behind creating this was to have a single place where recruiters and collaborators can learn about me and see the work I’ve done.
